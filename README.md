# clp_test

To start up the app, please:
1 - start the server with "node server.js" command at /server
2 - start the react app with "npm start" command at /my-app

The dashboard page should be both "/dashboard" and "/" paths.
The client page should be "/client" path.

MY SHORT INTRO
==============

Hi I am Gordon Wong, applying for a frontend developer role.

Here is my online CV and porfolio:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vVZK3WxM2YKbFz8B4Jk0UEnQ6cmf3m4G/view?usp=sharing
https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/3Z3M0O5FJ8P

For this code test, I self-learn...
1 - typescript
2 - socket io
3 - hook functions for react.js
Maybe the codes are not well written. I hope I can learn and practice well in your company.
However, I cannot complete the Jest part...since I got no time to learn it...I am so sorry about this.
