# Start the App

1 - start the server at /server

```bash
npm i
node server.js
```

2 - start the react app at /my-app
```bash
npm i
npm start
```

The dashboard page should be both "/dashboard" and "/" paths.
The client page should be "/client" path.

## My short intro
Hi I am **Gordon Wong**, applying for a frontend developer role.

Here is my online CV and porfolio:

For finishing the code test, I self-learn...

* **Typescript**
* **Socket.IO**
* **Hooks** for react.js

Maybe the codes are not well written. I hope I can learn and practice well in your company.

However, I cannot complete the Jest part...since I got no time to learn it...I am so sorry about this.
